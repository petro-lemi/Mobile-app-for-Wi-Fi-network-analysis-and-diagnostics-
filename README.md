# Mobile-app-for-Wi-Fi-network-analysis-and-diagnostics-
Mobile app for Wi-Fi network analysis and diagnostics with coverage visualization and layered tests
AIM:
The aim of this work is to design, develop, and implement a mobile application for supporting the analysis and monitoring of Wi-Fi networks. The application should enable signal strength measurement, interference analysis, transmission speed tests, automatic detection of devices in the network, and the creation of a coverage map. The system will support diagnosing connectivity problems and facilitate network management.

SCOPE OF WORK:

Literature review.

Analysis of existing solutions as well as technical and functional aspects of Wi-Fi network analysis applications.

Development and specification of functional and non-functional requirements of the application.

Design of the user interface for the iOS platform.

Implementation of application functionalities, including:

Signal strength measurement (RSSI),

Analysis of channel occupancy and interference,

Detection of devices within network range,

Signal coverage map (heatmap),

Automatic network settings optimization,

Transmission parameter testing across different ISO/OSI model layers.

Integration of the application with Firebase, Google Maps API, and a local database/cloud.

Functionality testing and performance optimization.

Preparation of project and user documentation.

Development of conclusions.
